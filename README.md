## General info
This project is simple game that I have created to practice the concepts of JavaFx.  This program displays a circle of radius 10 pixels filled with a random color at a random location on a pane. When you click the circle, it disappears and a new random- color circle is displayed at another random location. After 5 circles are clicked, the time spent is displayed in the pane.
